		<p>VELCO is turning 60 and we want you to help us celebrate.</p>
		<p>For 60 years, Rutland-based VELCO has served Vermont through collaboration and innovation. To celebrate this
			milestone, we are having a party to honor our past and support the next generation of innovators.</p>
		<p>On Thursday, October 27, 5:30-7:30, join us at the Vermont Farmers Food Center in downtown Rutland for a fun
			and energizing event - local musicians, local food, and a showcase of local makers' magic. A short presentation to
			celebrate VELCO's past, present and the future as a part of the Rutland and Vermont community will cap the evening.</p>
		<p>Tickets are $20 per person. All proceeds from the event support the creation of the Greater Rutland Makerspace,
			an initiative supported by Rutland Economic Development Corporation (REDC).</p>
