Rikon has outdone themselves with the 14" Professional Bandsaw. It has everything you could want in a serious
bandsaw - large table, robust fence, huge 14" resaw capacity, built-in LED light, foot brake, blade guides that
adjust without tools, and a powerful motor. Its steel frame features a a V-Wedge column design for maximum strength
under high blade tension, reducing column deflection. The 10-353 comes with a 3 HP 220V motor.</p>
<p>Quick-release lever releases blade tension while changing blades and at the end of the day. The large cast
iron table tilts for beveled cuts includes a heavy rip fence with integral inch scale and resawing pivot guide.
