					The 16 inch wide helical cutterhead rotates at 4700 rpm. Four spiral rows, each with 18 overlapping HSS cutters
					(for a total of 72 cutters) provide the cutting action for an exceptionally smooth finish. Each cutter has 4
					sharpened edges, and can be rotated to expose a fresh sharp edge until all 4 have become dull. If one cutter
					becomes nicked as a result of striking embedded metal, just that cutter needs to be rotated or replaced to
					eliminate the ridge that the nick causes on the workpiece.</p>
