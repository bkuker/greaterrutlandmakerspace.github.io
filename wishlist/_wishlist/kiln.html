This compact kiln is ideal for glass jewelry making and other small glass projects, or for metal clay and enameling.

The unit is equipped with a hinged side door for easy opening and loading of pieces, plus a second door for placing
finished glass beads on a mandrel for annealing. Both doors have wooden handles mounted away from the heat so they can
be grasped without gloves.
